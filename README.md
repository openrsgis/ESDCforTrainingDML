# TrainingDML-AI ESDC Example Code

## Overview
This repository contains example code for working with the Environmental Science Data Corpus (ESDC) in Training Data Markup Language - Artificial Intelligence (TrainingDML-AI) format. The ESDC is made publicly available to ensure that it is discoverable and reusable by researchers in the field of environmental science and machine learning.

## Data Source
The source corpus is available at [https://doi.org/10.57760/sciencedb.10436](https://doi.org/10.57760/sciencedb.10436), provided in the TrainingDML-AI format. TrainingDML-AI, proposed by Yue et al. (2022), is a format aligned with OGC standards and optimized for the exchange and retrieval of geospatial machine learning training data.

## Getting Started
To use these scripts, clone the repository and install the required libraries as listed in `requirements.txt`.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8
